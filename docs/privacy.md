# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-22

This Privacy Policy describes how **Cross Platform Uploader** (the "App") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.

## Information we collect
- **Authentication tokens**: OAuth access tokens for connected platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram). These are used to perform uploads you request.
- **Basic account info**: Depending on the platform, we may receive basic profile information (such as a user identifier) to confirm login.
- **Content you choose**: The video file you select on your device and the captions/titles/descriptions you enter.

## How we use information
- To authenticate you to the platforms you choose.
- To upload videos and metadata (caption/title/description) to the platforms you select.
- To troubleshoot and improve reliability (basic error messages shown in-app).

## Data storage
- **On-device storage**: Tokens may be stored locally on your device using secure storage.
- **No server storage (current build)**: The current app build does not require a backend server to store your content.

## Sharing
- We send your selected video and metadata to the platform(s) you choose **only** to perform the upload operation.
- We do not sell your personal information.

## Security
We use platform-provided OAuth flows and device secure storage where available. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Data deletion / revoking access
You can revoke access at any time by:
- Removing the app’s access in the platform’s security settings (Google/Meta/TikTok), and/or
- Using logout in the App (if available), and/or
- Uninstalling the App (which removes locally stored data).
